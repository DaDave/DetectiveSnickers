# GAME - Design Document

### Game Summary

The game is a point & click adventure in which you solve a murder case as Inspector Snickers. Since Inspector Snickers bumped his head during one of his missions, his cognitive abilities to solve the case are unfortunately somewhat limited

### Inspiration

**Inspiration A**

McPixel

**Inspiration B**

Secret of Mana

### Player Experience

The player controls the confused Inspector Snickers through 2D scenes and discovers the clue to the murderer by interacting with the people and objects in the rooms

### Platform

The game is developed to be playable in web.

### Development Software

* Godot as game engine

### Genre

- Point & Click
- Singleplayer

### Target Audience

The game is designed for people who want a fun but also exciting point & click experience where the protagonist has only one skill and must use it to solve the murder case through clever timing

## Concept

### Gameplay overview

The player navigates the officer through the scenes by clicking on the map. With the “I'M INSPECTOR SNICKERS” ability, the player interacts with the people and objects in the room

### Theme Interpretation (One Ability)

With the “I'M INSPECTOR SNICKERS” ability, the character can interact with objects and people verbally and by holding up his ID card. The right timing plays a decisive role here.

### Special Object Interpretation (Card)

Inspector Snickers gains authority by holding up his ID card. Objects that see his ID reveal information out of fear.
